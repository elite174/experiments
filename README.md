# Experiments


I always wanted to make beautiful things and discovered that Web technologies provide many tools for doing that. In order to learn the language, gain my skills in JS, CSS and stuff and have fun I will update the collection of small experiments [here](https://elite174.github.io/experiments/#/). 

I will use different things like animations, parallax, GLSL shaders etc. just for fun. Over time the collection will grow. I hope you'll like it :)
